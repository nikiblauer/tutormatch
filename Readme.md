# TutorMatch

## Project Description
The goal of this Project is to create a tool that enables students of universities to use the benefits of the learning techniques explained in the initial situation by combining concepts of peer tutoring and exchange programs. 

The proposed tool is a web application.
The intended target group for this web application is university students.

The application should provide a platform for students to register with information about which courses and topics relevant to academia they want to tutor, and which ones they want to be tutored in. Students are verified by their email issued by the university. For the limited scope of the projects, this project will only implement access for TU students and the ability to expand scope.

Afterwards, it should suggest matches with other users based on the overlaps in the topics chosen. For a match, both users have to provide tutoring in at least one topic the other user wants to be tutored in. Once matched, users should be able to use a chat function to get to know each other and plan further action. Further security and safety features like reporting users are explained in the feature list. 

Administrators should be able to add subjects, read user reports, block users from the app and add participating university identifiers.

## Target Group
**University students:** 
These are individuals currently enrolled in universities who are seeking academic assistance or are willing to provide tutoring in specific subjects. University students come from various academic disciplines, ranging from humanities and social sciences to STEM fields and beyond. Their academic backgrounds shape their needs for tutoring and their ability to offer assistance in specific subjects. Many students prefer learning from their peers due to the informal and relatable nature of peer tutoring. They may feel more comfortable asking questions and seeking help from someone who has recently experienced similar academic challenges. Offering tutoring services provides students with opportunities to enhance their communication, leadership, and teaching skills. By tutoring others, they reinforce their own understanding of the subject matter and contribute to the academic success of their peers. In addition, university students often have busy schedules, balancing coursework, extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and social commitments. Therefore, they value flexibility in accessing tutoring services, such as the ability to schedule sessions at convenient times and location.
